# CE-RISE Product Profile

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.17723238.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17723238) [![Schemas](https://img.shields.io/badge/Schema%20Files-LinkML%2C%20JSON%2C%20SHACL%2C%20OWL-32CD32)](https://ce-rise-models.codeberg.page/product-profile/)


This repository provides the core data model defining the mandatory Product Profile for any Digital Product Passport, including product attributes, identity, origin, and compliance information that defines "what the product is when introduced" rather than "what happens to it over time."

**Static Information Focus**: This Product Profile model contains time-invariant information about product identification, manufacturing origin, import/export compliance, and basic physical characteristics. Dynamic lifecycle events (supply chain movements, ownership changes, real-time tracking) are handled by separate data models.

---

## Data Model Structure

The Product Profile data model is structured as a hierarchical taxonomy defining **static foundational information** for Digital Product Passports. The model captures product identity and origin data that remains constant throughout the product lifecycle. Built using [LinkML](https://linkml.io/), it generates multiple schema formats (JSON Schema, SHACL, OWL).

**Core Philosophy**: This model answers fundamental questions about product identity:
- **"What is this product?"** → Product identification and classification
- **"Who made it and where?"** → Manufacturing origin and facility details  
- **"How did it get here?"** → Import/export compliance and customs
- **"What is it made of?"** → Basic materials and physical properties

Dynamic supply chain events, lifecycle tracking, and real-time traceability are addressed by separate, complementary data models.

### Workflow Sequence

#### **Step 1: GeneralProductInformation** 
Basic product identification with multiple identifier types:
- **LotBatchNumber**: Lot/batch tracking information
- **GTIN14**: Global Trade Item Number (14-digit format with GS1 integration)
- **SerialNumber**: Individual product serial numbers
- **ProductImages**: Product images for branding/visual identification (comma-separated URLs)
- **ProductType**: Product classification (3-digit GTIN prefix or alphanumeric code)
- **UniqueProductIdentifier**: Enables web link to product passport

#### **Step 2: ManufacturersInformation**
Manufacturer details with GS1-centric hierarchical structure:
- **OrganizationEntity**: Legal entity with GS1 GLN (preferred), LEI code, VAT number, company registration
- **ManufacturingFacility**: Physical facilities with facility GLN, Open Supply Hub ID, GPS coordinates

- **Name**: Manufacturer's legal name (Art 21 6. ESPR)
- **ManufacturingDate**: Month/year in manufacturing date codes
- **PostalAddress**: Physical address (Art 21 6. ESPR)
- **RegisteredTradeNameOrTradeMark**: Registered business names and trademarks
- **UniqueFacilityIdentifiers**: Value chain location identifiers
- **UniqueOperatorIdentifier**: Value chain actor identifiers
- **Website**: Manufacturer's website

#### **Step 3: InformationRelatedToTheImporter**
Comprehensive import/export tracking and compliance with EU customs regulations:
- **EoriNumber**: EU registration number with validated format (2-letter country code + up to 15 alphanumeric chars, e.g., GB123456789000)
- **CustomsDocumentation**: Customs documents (MRN, declaration IDs) with issuing authorities and digital document URLs (PDF/DOC/images)
- **ImportExportOperation**: Trade operations with type validation (IMPORT/EXPORT/TRANSIT/RE_EXPORT), dates, shipment IDs, quantities, Incoterms (FOB/CIF/EXW/DDP), and monetary values with currency codes
- **ImporterJurisdiction**: Legal establishment country using EU Publications Office 3-character country codes for EORI validation
- **TariffClassification**: International trade classification with 6-digit HS codes, 8-digit EU CN codes, 10-digit TARIC codes, descriptions, and duty rates
- **BorderCrossing**: Border crossing tracking with UN/LOCODE port codes (e.g., DEHAM, NLRTM), customs office codes, and precise crossing timestamps
- **AEOStatus**: Authorized Economic Operator certification (AEOC/AEOS/AEOF) for trusted trader benefits and trade facilitation
- **ImportAuthorization**: Import licenses and permits for restricted goods with validity periods and issuing authorities

#### **Step 4: ProductSpecification**
Universal basic characteristics that define any product at system entry (applicable to airplanes, t-shirts, sandwiches, etc.):
- **PhysicalAttributes**: Standardized physical measurements - weight in grams (150, 2.5e6), dimensions in millimeters LxWxH (300x200x100), volume for solids in mm³ (1e6) or liquids in ml (500). Scientific notation supported.
- **MaterialIdentification**: Structured material composition as JSON array - each material object contains name, percentage, and ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code. Example: `[{"material":"Cotton","percentage":80,"country":"TR"},{"material":"Polyester","percentage":20,"country":"CN"}]`
- **RegulatoryClassification**: Essential regulatory categories at entry - product category (Food, Electronics, Textiles, Machinery, Chemical), basic safety classification (Non-hazardous, Food-grade, Medical device, Hazardous) with optional GPC codes, GHS hazard classification, and CE marking categories

### Data Properties

Each class has a corresponding value property (e.g., `name_value`, `company_id_value`) that holds the actual data. All value properties are string type except where specified otherwise.

#### SQL Identifiers

Every data point in the model includes a `sql_identifier` annotation that serves as a unique, machine-friendly database identifier. These identifiers follow a structured namespace pattern to ensure uniqueness across the entire data model:

**Pattern**: `pro_[category]_[specific_name]`

**Features:**
- **Product Profile Prefix**: All identifiers start with `pro_` to clearly identify them as belonging to the Product Profile data model
- **Hierarchical Namespacing**: Uses category prefixes (`gen_info_`, `mfr_info_`, `imp_info_`, `spec_info_`) to provide context and prevent naming conflicts
- **Database-Friendly**: Uses underscores and avoids special characters for SQL compatibility
- **Unique Across Model**: No duplicate identifiers, even when similar concepts appear in different parts of the hierarchy
- **Reasonable Length**: Abbreviated but meaningful names that balance clarity with practical database usage

**Examples:**
- `pro_gen_info_gtin14` - GTIN-14 identifier in General Product Information
- `pro_mfr_info_facility` - Manufacturing facility in Manufacturer Information  
- `pro_imp_info_eori` - EORI number in Import/Export Information
- `pro_spec_info_materials` - Material composition in Product Specifications

This identifier system enables seamless integration with databases and ensures clear data model composition when combining with other CE-RISE data models.
